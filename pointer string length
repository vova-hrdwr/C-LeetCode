The function should take a character pointer as an argument and return the length of the string it points to.

Constraints:

Do not use the array subscript operator ('[ ]'); instead, use the dereference operator ('*').
Avoid using a numeric counter; instead, employ pointer arithmetic.
Use assert to check that the pointer is not NULL.
Study: Pay attention once more to the use of the const qualifier in the pointer parameter. What is the distinction between the following definitions?

#include <stddef.h>
#include <assert.h>
size_t StringLength(const char* str)
{
    const char* test; /*Define a new pointer*/
    test = str; /*the pointer *test and *str point to the same adress*/
    /*str define to point char variables*/
    assert(str != NULL); /*assert to verify that the pointer is not NULL*/
    
   
    while (*test != '\0')
    {
        test++;
    }
    return test - str ;
}
