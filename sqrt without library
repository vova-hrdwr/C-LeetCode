Write a function named SquareRoot that takes a non-negative float as input and returns its square root, without relying on any library functions.

I used a numerical algorith in this task:

float SquareRoot(float num)
{
    float sqrt = num/2;
    float temp = 0;
    
    while (sqrt != temp)
    {
        temp = sqrt;
        sqrt = (sqrt +num/sqrt)/2;
    }
    return sqrt;
}
